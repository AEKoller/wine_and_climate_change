Our Current Research Questions:
## Is there a correlation between rising temperatures and its effect on wine production?
Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and wine production.
Null: There is no statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and wine production.

Analysis:
We analyzed over 100 countries to determine if a correlation exists between rising temperatures and wine production. While we did see weak to moderate correlation in some countries, overall we determined that a statistically significant correlation across all countries cannot be concluded with our current data sets. 

Greece is an example where we see a weak to moderate correlation, with an r-value of -.5. As temperatures have increased, especially over the last decade, wine production has decreased. 

South Africa is an example where we see a weak correlation, with an r-value of .39. Temperatures here have fluctuated, but overtime have not increased or decreased significantly. However, wine production has been increasing consistently since 1980. This indicates that there are other factors as play influencing wine production.

## Is there a correlation between rising temperatures and the creation of new wine industries in regions previously unfit for wine production?
Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and new wine industries.
Null: There is no statistically significant correlation between rising temperatures and the creation of new wine industries.
## Which geographical regions can expect to see an increase in wine production and which regions can expect to see a decrease in wine production given the expected rise in temperature?
Hypothesis: There is statistically significant difference in the expected change in wine production between geographical regions as a result of the expected rise in temperature.
We expect to see geographical regions traditionally too cold to grow wine to see an increase in production due to rising temperatures, and those traditionally ideal to see a decrease in wine production.
Null: There is no statistically significant difference in the expected change in wine production between geographical regions as a result of the expected rise in temperature.
